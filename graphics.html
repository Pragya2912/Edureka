        <h2>What Is Graphic Design? A Beginner’s Guide to This Creative Career</h2>
        When you think of graphic design, do you think of artistic advertisements? Eye-grabbing graphics on websites?
        Stunningly arranged spreads in magazines? While these examples certainly fit under the graphic design
        definition, the term encompasses a lot: posters, infographics, book covers, product labels, logos, business
        cards, signs, website layouts, mobile apps, software interfaces—the list goes on. <br><br>

        So what is graphic design, exactly? Listing these graphic design examples is a good start, but it doesn’t paint
        the full picture. While covering the details and intricacies of the entire graphic design field might not be
        possible in one article, this high-level overview will help you better understand this creative career field.
        <br><br>

        If you’re at all interested in becoming a professional graphic designer, keep reading to learn the basics of the
        field. <br><br>


        <h4>First, what is graphic design?</h4>
        According to the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA), graphic design is defined as “the art and practice
        of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content.” In other terms, graphic
        design communicates certain ideas or messages in a visual way. These visuals can be as simple as a business
        logo, or as complex as page layouts on a website.
        <br><br>
        “Graphic design takes graphical and textual elements and implements them into multiple types of media,” says
        designer Alexandros Clufetos, when asked to elaborate on the graphic design definition. “It helps the producer
        connect with the consumer. It conveys the message of the project, event, campaign or product.”
        <br><br>

        Graphic design can be used by companies to promote and sell products through advertising, by websites to convey
        complicated information in a digestible way through infographics, or by businesses to develop an identity
        through branding, among other things.
        <br><br>

        “Every day, we take many of the subtly artistic things around us for granted. But hidden in every magazine
        corner, exit sign or textbook lies a set of design ideas that influence our perceptions,” says Jacob Smith,
        founder of illustration studio ProductViz.
        <br><br>

        It’s also important to remember that although many graphic design projects have commercial purposes like
        advertisements and logos, it is also used in other contexts and graphic design work is often created purely as a
        means for artistic expression.
        <br><br>

        <h4>Graphic design basics</h4>
        <br>
        To better understand the meaning of graphic design, it is important to be aware of the elements and principles
        that make up design. Elements are used in conjunction or opposition with each other to create visually striking
        and impactful designs.
        <br><br>

        These graphic design elements include: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Color</li>
            <li>Form</li>
            <li>Line</li>
            <li>Shape</li>
            <li>Size</li>
            <li>Space</li>
            <li>Texture</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        Graphic designers also adhere to the principles of design, which are essentially a set of guidelines that help a
        design achieve effective composition. These basic principles aid in creating balance and stability for the piece
        of work.
        <br><br>

        These graphic design principles include:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Balance</li>
            <li>Contrast</li>
            <li>Emphasis</li>
            <li>Movement</li>
            <li>Proportion</li>
            <li>Rhythm</li>
        </ul>

        <br>


        You’ve heard the old saying that “rules are meant to be broken,” which can certainly ring true in this case. But
        a good graphic designer must first understand these principles before making the conscious decision to break
        them. <br>
        <br>

        <h4>Types of graphic design</h4>
        <br>
        As mentioned earlier, there is no single graphic design meaning. Graphic design is composed of many fields and
        specializations, ranging from print and web design to animation and motion graphics. Graphic design offers
        opportunities and options for individuals of almost any interest.
        <br>
        <br>

        If you’d asked someone 30 years ago to define graphic design, their answer would have likely been focused on
        print-related examples like magazines, movie posters and advertisements. Now we’re living in the digital age,
        which has given birth to several new types of graphic design.
        <br>
        <br>


        Some of the most notable modern-day graphic design examples stem from advancements in technology. Here’s a
        glimpse of some of these types of graphic design:
        <br><br>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Website design</b> involves creating engaging and intuitive web pages for users. This includes
                overall layout,
                color scheme and navigation.</li>

            <li><b>User experience (UX) design</b> is focused on ensuring a website or application is easy and
                satisfying to use.
                These designers emphasize value, usability, adoptability and desirability.</li>

            <li><b>Motion graphics design</b>—or animation—brings visual elements to life through special effects, TV
                shows, video
                games and movies.</li>

        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Common graphic design jobs</h4>
        <br>
        With technological advancements introducing new types of graphic design, there has also been an emergence of new
        graphic design jobs. This evolution has changed the entire landscape of careers in this field. <br><br>

        Demand for “traditional” graphic designers who work primarily for print publishers has fallen substantially, but
        that doesn’t tell the whole story. Employment of graphic designers in computer systems design services is
        projected to grow by 24 percent through 2028, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).1 Much of this
        demand is spurred by business’ and organizations’ increased need for digital graphics and imagery as they aim to
        increase their digital presence.
        <br><br>

        So with that said, what are some common graphic design job titles? We analyzed more than 30,000 job postings
        calling for a graphic design degree over the past year.2 The data helped us determine the most common job
        titles:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Graphic designer</li>
            <li>User experience (UX) designer</li>
            <li>Web designer</li>
            <li>Art director</li>
            <li>Creative director</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        As you can see, once armed with the proper knowledge and training, there are several graphic design job options
        out there. You have the ability to cater your career to your personal skills and interests.

        <br><br>




        <h4>Popular graphic design tools</h4>
        <br>
        Now that you know what type of jobs and specializations are out there, it’s helpful to familiarize yourself with
        the graphic design tools that help get the job done. One of the most basic, and least expensive, tools designers
        use is a sketchbook. Graphic designers will often sketch out ideas or rough drafts on paper before turning to a
        computer to complete the process. <br><br>

        That being said, computers and design software are essentials in today’s digital climate, even if you are
        designing for print. The type of computer you need is based on preference, but when it comes to software, Adobe
        products such as Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign are mainstays in the graphic design world. If you are just
        beginning and don’t want to commit to the high price tag Adobe products often carry, similar free open-source
        software such as GIMP can help you begin to master the basics. <br><br>

        Lastly, ideas and inspiration are what a graphic designer needs most. “You need to have a solid concept serving
        as the foundation of your design and communication,” explains Chad Birenbaum, co-founder of Duckpin Design.
        “This concept and idea needs to work on paper first and then the computer should be used as a tool to bring the
        concept to life.”

        <br><br>

        Graphic designers gain inspiration from the world around them, so if you are worried you aren’t creative enough,
        go outside, bounce ideas off your peers or seek ideas from the internet. There plenty of inspiring graphic
        design blogs that can help get your creative juices flowing.
        <br><br>

        <h4>Create your future in graphic design</h4>
        <br>
        What is graphic design, exactly? As you’ve just learned, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all definition. There are
        countless ways to use graphic design to solve business problems or evoke inspiration. It’s up to you to
        determine what graphic design means to you and your future career. <br><br>

        Having an eye for design is a great start, but do you possess the other natural traits of a graphic designer?

        <h4>Graphic Design is about Molding the User Experience Visually</h4>
        <br>

        Graphic design is an ancient craft, dating back past Egyptian hieroglyphs to at least 17,000-year-old cave
        paintings. It’s a term that originated in the 1920s’ print industry. It continues to cover a range of activities
        including logo creation. Graphic design in this sense concerns aesthetic appeal and marketing. Graphic designers
        attract viewers using images, color and typography. However, graphic designers working in user experience (UX)
        design must justify stylistic choices regarding, say, image locations and font with a human-centered approach.
        That means you need to focus on—and seek to empathize the most with—your specific users while you create
        good-looking designs that maximize usability. Aesthetics must serve a purpose—in UX design we don’t create art
        for art’s sake. So, graphic designers must branch into visual design. When designing for UX, you should:
        <br><br>

        <ol>
            <li>Consider the information architecture of your interactive designs, to ensure accessibility for users.
            </li>

            <li>Leverage graphic design skills to create work that considers the entire user experience, including
                users’ visual processing abilities.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        For instance, if an otherwise pleasing mobile app can’t offer users what they need in several thumb-clicks, its
        designer/s will have failed to marry graphic design to user experience. The scope of graphic design in UX covers
        the creation of beautiful designs that users find highly pleasurable, meaningful and usable. <br><br>

        <h4>Graphic Design is Emotional Design</h4>
        <br>
        Although to work in the digital age means you must design with interactive software, graphic design still
        revolves around age-old principles. It’s crucial that you strike the right chord with users from their first
        glance—hence graphic design’s correspondence with emotional design. As a graphic designer, then, you should have
        a firm understanding of color theory and how vital the right choice of color scheme is. Color choices must
        reflect not only the organization (e.g., blue suits banking) but also users’ expectations (e.g., red for alerts;
        green for notifications to proceed). You should design with an eye for how elements match the tone (e.g.,
        sans-serif fonts for excitement or happiness). You also need to design for the overall effect, and note how you
        shape users’ emotions as you guide them from, for instance, a landing page to a call to action. Often, graphic
        designers are involved in motion design for smaller screens. They will carefully monitor how their works’
        aesthetics match their users’ expectations. They can enhance their designs’ usability in a flowing, seamless
        experience by anticipating the users’ needs and mindsets. With user psychology in mind, it’s important to stay
        focused on some especially weighty graphic design considerations, namely these: <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Symmetry and Balance (including symmetry types)</li>

            <li>Flow</li>

            <li>Repetition</li>

            <li>Pattern</li>

            <li>The Golden Ratio (i.e., proportions of 1:1.618)</li>

            <li>The Rule of Thirds (i.e., how users’ eyes recognize good layout)</li>

            <li>Typography (encompassing everything from font choice to heading weight)</li>

            <li>Audience Culture (regarding color use—e.g., red as an alert or, in some Eastern cultures, a signal of good
            fortune—and reading pattern: e.g., left to right in Western cultures)</li>
        </ul>
<br>
<img src="/Images/graphic2.png" alt="">
<br><br>

Overall, your mission—as far as graphic design goes in UX and UI design—is to display information harmoniously. You should ensure that beauty and usability go hand in hand, and therefore your design can discreetly carry your organization’s ideals to your users. When you establish a trustworthy visual presence, you hint to users that you know what they want to do – not just because you’ve arranged aesthetically pleasing elements that are where your users expect to find them, or help them intuit their way around, but because the values which your designs display mirror theirs, too. Your visual content will quickly decide your design’s fate, so be sure not to overlook the slightest trigger that may put users off.
