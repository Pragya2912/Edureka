        <h1>What is React? </h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/ReactJS-Tutorial.png" alt="">
        <p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It’s ‘V’ in MVC. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.</p>
        <p>React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug</p>
        
        <h1>Features of React.js</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>There are unique features are available on React because that it is widely popular.</p>
        <p>&bull; <b>Use JSX:</b>  It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript. It makes it easier for us to create templates.</p>
        <p>&bull; <b>Virtual DOM:</b> Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM. It is exactly the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen</p>
        <p>&bull; <b>One-way Data Binding:</b> This feature gives you better control over your application.</p>
        <p>&bull; <b>Component:</b>  A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components make the task of building UIs much easier. You can see a UI broken down into multiple individual pieces called components and work on them independently and merge them all in a parent component which will be your final UI. </p>
        <p>&bull; <b>Performance:</b> React.js use JSX, which is faster compared to normal JavaScript and HTML. Virtual DOM is a less time taking procedure to update webpages content</p>
        
        <h1>Introduction to JSX</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Let us see a sample JSX code:</p>
        <p>const ele = &lt;h1&gt;This is sample JSX&lt;/h1&gt;;</p>
        <p>The above code snippet somewhat looks like HTML and it also uses a JavaScript-like variable but is neither HTML nor JavaScript, it is JSX. JSX is basically a syntax extension of regular JavaScript and is used to create React elements. These elements are then rendered to the React DOM</p>
    
        <h1>Why JSX?</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>1) It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.</p>
        <p>2) It makes it easier for us to create templates.</p>
        <p>3) Instead of separating the markup and logic in separated files, React uses components for this purpose.</p>
    
        <h1>ReactJS | Basics of ES, Babel and npm</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p><b>What is ES?</b></p>
        <p>ES is an abbreviation used for ECMA Script. It is a standard for different scripting languages such as JS (JavaScript) made by ECMA. 
            ECMA is an abbreviation used for European Computer Manufacturers Association. It is a standard organization based out of Switzerland which takes care of ES. ES11 (2020) is updated in June 2020 and its nomenclature is like that the year in which the update is released then the name will be a year plus one such as ES10 (2019)</p>
         <p>n ECMA Script6 also called ES6 and ECMAScript 2015 various new features were added.The features are listed below:</p>
         <p>The let keyword</p>
           <p>&bull; The const keyword</p>
           <p> &bull;Arrow functions</p>
            <p>&bull;Classes</p>
            <p>&bull;Modules</p>
            <p>&bull;The Rest Parameters</p>
            <p>&bull;The Spread Operator</p>
           <p>&bull; Destructuring Assignment</p>
           <p>&bull; The Object Destructuring Assignment</p>
           <p> &bull;Default values for Function Parameters</p>
           <p> &bull;Template Literals</p>
            <p>&bull;The for…of Loop</p>

            <p><b>What is Babel?</b> </p>
            <p>Babel is a free and open-source JavaScript Transcompiler that is mainly used to convert ES6 (2015) and above code into a backward compatible code that can be run by older JS engines. Babel deploys a technique called Polyfill which basically means to fill many areas</p>
            <p><b>What is npm?</b></p>
            <p>npm is an abbreviation used for the node package manager. It is a package manager for JavaScript. It is the default package manager that comes with NodeJS when you install it. It consists of a command-line interface and an online database of public packages and private packages that are paid which is called the npm Registry.</p>
            
            <h1>ReactJS | ReactDOM</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page. ReactDOM provides the developers with an API containing the following methods and a few more</p>
            <p>&bull; render() </p>
            <p>&bull; findDOMNode()</p>
            <p>&bull;unmountComponentAtNode()</p>
            <p>&bull; hydrate()</p>
            <p>&bull; createPortal()</p>

            <h1>ReactJS | Virtual DOM</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>React uses Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM(a virtual representation of the DOM). So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM. It is exactly the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen. So each time there is a change in the state of our application, the virtual DOM gets updated first instead of the real DOM.</p>
             
            <h1>ReactJS | Lists</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>Lists are very useful when it comes to developing the UI of any website. Lists are mainly used for displaying menus in a website, for example, the navbar menu. In regular JavaScript, we can use arrays for creating lists. We can create lists in React in a similar manner as we do in regular JavaScript.</p>
             
            <h1>ReactJS | Keys</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used to React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists. The next thing that comes to mind is that what should be good to be chosen as key for the items in lists. It is recommended to use a string as a key that uniquely identifies the items in the list</p>
            

            <h1>ReactJS | Refs</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>Refs are a function provided by React to access the DOM element and the React element that you might have created on your own. They are used in cases where we want to change the value of a child component, without making use of props and all. They also provide us with good functionality as we can use callbacks with them. </p>
        
            <h1>ReactJS | Transition Group</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>While React manages different components and their behavior to make any web app interactive it contains no methodology of adding aesthetics to the app itself. The animation is considered to be one of the most used methods to add aesthetics to an app, we can add animation to a React App using an explicit group of components known as the React Transition Group. </p>
            
            <h1>ReactJS | AJAX and API</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>APIs are used for fetching data from the server and using AJAX and API we call data asynchronously and show it in our HTML. You can make API requests by using browser build in fetch function or third party libraries like Axios. You can make API requests anywhere but it is totally recommended that you should make an API call in componentDidMount() life cycle method</p>
            <p><b>Reasons to use componentDidMount():</b> So, this can be really simple by just putting the API request in componentDidMount.</p>
            <p>&bull; Using componentDidMount makes sure that data won’t be loaded until after the initial render which is really important.</p>
            <p>&bull; Using componentDidMount make sure that the data is only fetched from client</p>
