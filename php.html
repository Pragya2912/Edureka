        The term PHP is an acronym for Hypertext Preprocessor. It is a server-side scripting language that is used for
        web development. It can be easily embedded with HTML files. HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file. The
        PHP codes are executed on the server-side whereas HTML codes are directly executed on the browser. <br><br>

        <h4>
            Why we learn PHP ?
        </h4><br>
        It is one of the widely used open-source general-purpose scripting language that is used for backend
        Development. Apart from this, let’s see why we should learn it. <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Easy to Learn:</b> It is easier to learn for anyone who has come across to any programming language
                for the
                first time.</li>
            <li><b>Free of Cost:</b> Since it is an open-source language, therefore developers are allowed to use its
                components
                and all methods for free.</li>
            <li><b>Flexible:</b> Since It is a dynamically typed language, therefore there are no hard rules on how to
                build
                features using it.</li>
            <li><b>Supports nearly all databases:</b> It supports all the widely used databases, including MySQL, ODBC,
                SQLite etc.</li>
            <li><b>Secured:</b> It has multiple security levels provides us a secure platform for developing websites as
                it has
                multiple security levels.</li>
            <li><b>Huge Community Support:</b> It is loved and used by a huge number of developers. The developers share
                their
                knowledge with other people of the community that want to know about it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Introduction</h4><br>

        The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed
        specifically for web development. It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very
        simple to learn and use. The files have the extension “.php”. <br>

        Rasmus Lerdorf inspired the first version of PHP and participated in the later versions. It is an interpreted
        language and it does not require a compiler. <br>
        <ul>

            <li>PHP code is executed in the server.</li>
            <li>It can be integrated with many databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL,
                Sybase,
                and
                Informix.</li>
            <li>It is powerful to hold a content management system like WordPress and can be used to control user
                access.</li>
            <li>It supports main protocols like HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, IMAP, FTP, and others.</li>
            <li>Websites like www.facebook.com and www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.</li>
            <li>One of the main reasons behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can
                also
                be
                written in a PHP file.</li>
            <li>The thing that differentiates PHP from the client-side language like HTML is, that PHP codes are
                executed on
                the
                server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are first executed on the
                server
                and
                then the result is returned to the browser.</li>
            <li>The only information that the client or browser knows is the result returned after executing the PHP
                script
                on
                the server and not the actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files can support other
                client-side
                scripting languages like CSS and JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        Other characteristics of PHP are as follows.
        <br>
        <ul>

        <li>Simple and fast</li>
        <li>Efficient</li>
        <li>Secured</li>
        <li>Flexible</li>
        <li>Cross-platform, it works with major operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li>
        <li>Open Source</li>
        <li>Powerful Library Support</li>
        <li>Database Connectivity</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h4>
        Why should we use PHP?
        </h4>

PHP can actually do anything related to server-side scripting or more popularly known as the backend of a website. For example, PHP can receive data from forms, generate dynamic page content, can work with databases, create sessions, send and receive cookies, send emails, etc. There are also many hash functions available in PHP to encrypt users’ data which makes PHP secure and reliable to be used as a server-side scripting language. So these are some of PHP’s abilities that make it suitable to be used as a server-side scripting language. You will get to know more of these abilities in further tutorials. <br>
Even if the above abilities do not convince you of PHP, there are some more features of PHP. PHP can run on all major operating systems like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc. Almost all of the major servers available today like Apache supports PHP. PHP allows using a wide range of databases. And the most important factor is that it is free to use and download and anyone can download PHP from its official source: <a href="www.php.net">www.php.net</a> . <br>
Please refer to setting up the development environment and basic syntax of PHP in further articles. <br><br>
<h4>
What’s new in PHP 7.0:

<li>PHP 7 is faster than the previous versions.</li>
<li>PHP 7 supports new operators.</li>
<li>PHP 7 supports better Error Handling functionalities.</li>
<li>PHP 7 supports stricter declarations for types in function parameters.</li>

<h4>
Disadvantages of PHP:
</h4>
<ol>
<li>PHP is not secure as it is open source.</li>
<li>Not good to create desktop applications.</li>
<li>Not suitable for large Web Applications- Php code is hard to maintain since it is not very modular.</li>
<li>Modification Problem – PHP does not allow the change in the core behavior of the web applications.</li>
</ol>
