        <h1>AngularJS</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/AngularJS-Tutorial.png" alt="">
        <p>AngularJS was developed in 2008-2009 by Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons and is now maintained by Google. AngularJS is a Javascript open-source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop single-page web applications(SPAs). It is a continuously growing and expanding framework which provides better ways for developing web applications.</p>  
        <p>It changes the static HTML to dynamic HTML. Its features like dynamic binding and dependency injection eliminate the need for code that we have to write otherwise. AngularJS is rapidly growing and because of this reason, we have different versions of AngularJs with the latest stable being 1.7.7. It is also important to note that Angular is different from AngularJs. It is an open-source project which can be freely used and changed by anyone. It extends HTML attributes with Directives, and data is bound with HTML.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Key Points:</b></p>
        <p>&bull; AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that is mainly used for Frontend Development.</p>
           <p> &bull; It is used for making Single Page Applications(SPA).</p>
          <p>  &bull; It is open source and is completely free for everyone.</p>
           <p> &bull; It uses the Model, View, Control(MVC) pattern for developing projects.</p>

           <h3>Why use it?</h3>
           <hr>
           <br>
           <p> <b>Easy to work with: </b>All you need to know to work with AngularJs is basics of HTML,CSS and Javascript,not necessary to be an expert in these technologies.</p>
          <p> <b> Time-saving: </b>AngularJs allows us to work with components and hence we can use them again which saves time and unnecessary code.</p>
          <p> <b> Ready to use template:</b> AngularJs is mainly plain HTML, and it mainly makes use of the plain HTML template and passes it to the DOM and then the AngularJS compiler. It traverses the templates and then they are ready to use.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Key Features: </b>There are numerous features of AngularJS that contribute to creating efficient applications. Some of the features are described below:</p>

          <p><b>Model Control View: </b>An architecture is basically a software pattern used to develop an application. It consists of three components: </p>
          <p> <b>Model: </b>This component consists of a database & is responsible for managing the data & logic of the application. It responds to the request made by the View component & the instruction given by the Controller component, in order to update itself.</p>
          <p> <b>View:</b> This component is responsible for displaying the application data to the users. The View is basically the user interface that helps to render the required data to the user, with the help of the AngularJS expressions</p>
          <p> <b>Controller: </b>This component is responsible for communicating & interacting between the Model & the View Component, i.e. its main job is to connect the model and the view component. It helps to validate the input data by implementing some business logic that manipulates the state of the data model.</p>  
         <h3>Benefits of AngularJS:</h3>
         <hr>
         <br>
         <p> <b>Depending Injection: </b> Dependency Injection is a software design pattern. It works on the basis of Inversion of Control. Inversion control means objects do not create other objects. Instead, they get these objects from an outside source. The dependent object is not created by the primary object after that then uses its methods. Instead, an external source creates the dependent object and gives it to the source object for further usage. On the basis of dependency injection, we create a service to acquire all the information from the database and get into the model class. </p>
         <h3>Pros of AngularJS</h3>
         <hr>
         <br>
         <p> &bull; It facilitates the Two-way Binding that helps to render correspondingly the changes made to the view or the model.</p>
          <p> &bull; It helps to create the responsive web application, along with providing the prototyping that can be utilized to load the application faster.</p>
            <p>&bull; It uses the concept of directive that helps to add the functionality to the application. For this, the overall length of the code reduces along with discarding the repetition of the code that is specific to perform the particular task.</p>
        
            <h3>Cons of AngularJS:</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>&bull; As this framework belongs to Javascript, so it is required to have prior knowledge of Javascript.</p>
            <p>&bull; If new to this framework, then the debugging the scope can be difficult task.</p>
             
            <h3>AngularJS Expressions</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>Expressions in AngularJS are used to bind application data to HTML. The expressions are resolved by AngularJS and the result is returned back to where the expression is written. The expressions in AngularJS are written in double braces: {{ expression }}. </p>
            <p></p>    
            
            <h3>AngularJS | Modules</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>The AngularJS module defines the functionality of the application which is applied on the entire HTML page. It helps to link many components. So it is just a group of related components. It is a container which consists of different parts like controllers, services, directives.</p>
            
            <h3>AngularJS ng-model Directive</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>The ngModel directive is a directive that is used to bind the values of the HTML controls (input, select, and textarea) or any custom form controls, and stores the required user value in a variable and we can use that variable whenever we require that value. It also is used during form validations. The various form input types (text, checkbox, radio, number, email, URL, date, datetime-local time, month, week) can be used with the ngModel directive.</p>
            
            <h3>AngularJS Data Binding</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>Angular provides a function Data Binding which helps us to have an almost real-time reflection of the input given by the user i.e. it creates a connection between Model and View. Data Binding is a way to synchronize the data between the model and view components automatically. AngularJS implements data-binding that treats the model as the single-source-of-truth in your application & for all the time, the view is a projection of the model. Unlike React, angular supports two-way binding. In this way, we can make the code more loosely coupled. Data binding can be categorized into 2 types, ie., One-way Binding & Two-way Binding.</p>
            <p><b>One-way Binding:</b> This type of binding is unidirectional, i.e. this binds the data flow from either component to view(DOM) or from the view(DOM) to the component. There are various techniques through which the data flow can be bind from component to view or vice-versa.</p>
             
            <p><b>Two-way Binding:</b> In this type of binding, the immediate changes to the view & component, will be reflected automatically, i.e. when the changes made to the component or model then the view will render the changes simultaneously. Similarly, when the data is altered or modified in the view then the model or component will be updated accordingly. </p>
        
            <h3>AngularJS | Scope</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>Scope in AngularJS is the binding part of HTML view and JavaScript controller. When you add properties into the scope object in the JavaScript controller, only then the HTML view gets access to those properties. There are two types of Scope in AngularJS. </p>
             <p>&bull;$Scope</p>
            <p>&bull;$rootScope</p>

            <h3>AngularJS Select Boxes</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>The Select Boxes in AngularJS can be utilized to create dropdown lists, that are based on the objects or an array. The Select box can be created in 2 ways, i.e., either by using the ng-options directive that is used to build and bind HTML elements with options to model property or by using the ng-repeat directive that is used to repeat a set of HTML code for a number of times or once per item in a collection of items, & is mostly used on arrays and objects.</p>
            
            <h3>AngularJS | SQL</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>In any web application we need to save, update, insert and fetch data to and from a database. AngularJS is a JavaScript MVC or Model-View-Controller framework developed by Google. It helps developers to build well structured, easily testable, and maintainable front-end applications.</p>

                <h3>AngularJS HTML DOM</h3>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>The HTML DOM in AngularJS facilitates the directives that bind the application data with the attributes of HTML DOM elements.</p>
               
                <h3>AngularJS Events</h3>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>An Events in AngularJS can be used to perform particular tasks, based on the action taken. Both Angular Event & the HTML Event will be executed & will not overwrite with an HTML Event</p>
               
                <h3>AngularJS | API</h3>
                <hr>

                <h3>AngularJS Routing</h3>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>Routing in AngularJS is used when the user wants to navigate to different pages in an application but still wants it to be a single page application. AngularJS routes enable the user to create different URLs for different content in an application. The ngRoute module helps in accessing different pages of an application without reloading the entire application.</p>
                
                <h3>AngularJS | Directives</h3>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>Directives are markers in the Document Object Model(DOM). Directives can be used with any of controller or HTML tag which will tell the compiler what exact operation or behavior is expected. There are some directives present which is predefined but if a developer wants he can create new directives (custom-directive).</p>
                
                <h3>AngularJS | Filters</h3>
                <hr>
                <br>
                <p>There are some filters that are added in the AngularJS for the sake of making the formatting and working with data easier. There are several in-built filters in AngularJS. They are listed here along with some examples to make the understanding easier.</p>
                <p><b>Basic Syntax:</b></p>
                <p>Filters are generally added to the expressions by using the pipe (|) character.
                    For example, the filter {{ fullName | uppercase }} formats the fullName into the uppercase format.</p>
            
                <h3>AngularJS Converting Functions</h3>
