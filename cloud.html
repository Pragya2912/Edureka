        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>In simple terms, cloud computing is a range of services delivered over the internet, or “the cloud.”
            It means using remote servers to store and access data instead of relying on local hard drives and
            private datacenters.

            <br>
            Before cloud computing existed, organizations had to purchase and maintain their own servers to
            meet business needs. This required buying enough server space to reduce the risk of downtime and
            outages, and to accommodate peak traffic volume. As a result, large amounts of server space went
            unused for much of the time. Today’s cloud service providers allow companies to reduce the need for
            onsite servers, maintenance personnel, and other costly IT resources
        </p>

        <h2>Benefits of cloud computing</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h3>Agility</h3>
        <p>The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and
            build nearly anything that you can imagine. You can quickly spin up resources as you need them–from
            infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things, machine
            learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.

            You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from idea to implementation
            several orders of magnitude faster than before. This gives you the freedom to experiment, test new
            ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform your business.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Elasticity</h3>
        <p>With cloud computing, you don’t have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of
            business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the amount of resources that you actually
            need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as your
            business needs change.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Cost Savings</h3>
        <p>The cloud allows you to trade fixed expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable
            expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than
            what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Deploy globally in minutes</h3>
        <p>With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example,
            AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your application in multiple physical
            locations with just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces
            latency and improves their experience. </p>

        <h2>How does cloud computing work?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>There are three types of cloud computing deployment models:<b>private cloud, public cloud, and hybrid
                cloud.</b></p>

        <p> <b>Private cloud </b>provides a proprietary cloud environment dedicated to a single business entity,
            with physical components stored on-premises or at a vendor’s datacenter. Because the private cloud
            is only accessible to a single business, this model offers a high degree of control. Advantages
            include customized architecture, advanced security protocols, and the ability to extend computing
            resources in a virtualized environment as needed. In many cases, an organization maintains a private
            cloud infrastructure on-site while delivering cloud computing services to internal users via the
            intranet. In other instances, the organization contracts with a third-party cloud vendor to host and
            maintain exclusive servers off site.</p>

        <p><b>Public cloud </b>uses the internet to store and manage access to data and applications. It’s
            completely virtualized, providing an environment where shared resources are leveraged as needed.
            Because these resources are delivered over the web, the public cloud deployment model allows
            organizations to scale more easily—the ability to pay for cloud resources as needed is a huge
            advantage over local servers. In addition, public cloud service providers offer robust security
            measures to protect user data from being accessed by other tenants.</p>

        <p><b> Hybrid cloud</b> combines private and public cloud models, allowing organizations to leverage the
            benefits of shared resources while using existing IT infrastructure for critical security
            requirements. The hybrid cloud model allows companies to store confidential data internally and
            access it via applications running in the public cloud. To comply with privacy regulations, for
            example, an organization could store sensitive user data in a private cloud and perform
            resource-intensive computation in the public cloud</p>

        <p>In addition, businesses can choose to take a multi-cloud approach, which means they use more than one
            public cloud service. This approach can be used to distribute workloads across multiple cloud
            platforms, allowing organizations to optimize their environments for performance, flexibility, and
            cost savings.</p>

        <h2>What are some cloud computing examples?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>While cloud computing can take many forms, the majority falls into three key areas. Each type of
            cloud computing provides its own set of advantages.</p>
        <h2>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Traditionally, software was installed directly on each individual device. With the software as a
            service (SaaS) computing model, web applications are hosted in the cloud to reduce costs through
            pay-as-you-go pricing. End users can easily connect to the cloud application through a web browser
            or mobile device, and there’s no need for IT departments to get involved with management or
            maintenance. Examples include Gmail, Salesforce CRM, and RightSignature, as well as cloud storage
            services like OneDrive and Dropbox.</p>
        <h2>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The infrastructure as a service (IaaS) computing model moves an organization's entire datacenter to
            the cloud. The business rents virtual machines (VMs), virtual servers, operating systems, and other
            IT infrastructure on a pay-as-you-go basis. The cloud service provider is responsible for
            maintaining all data storage servers and networking hardware, eliminating the need for a
            resource-intensive, on-site installation. Examples include Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle
            Cloud, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
        <h2>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The platform as a service computing model gives organizations the power to develop software without
            needing to maintain the backend environment. PaaS vendors optimize environments for each tenant's
            unique needs, and often include supplemental development tools such as storage resources, compile
            services, and version control. </p>
