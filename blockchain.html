        <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/blockchain-tutorial.png" alt="">
        <p>A blockchain is a constantly growing ledger which keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place in a secure, chronological, and immutable way.</p>
        <p><b>Ledger: </b>It is a file that is constantly growing.</p>
        <p><b>Permanent:</b> It means once the transaction goes inside a blockchain, you can put up it permanently in the ledger.</p>
        <p><b>Secure: </b> Blockchain placed information in a secure way. It uses very advanced cryptography to make sure that the information is locked inside the blockchain.</p>
        <p><b>Chronological:</b> Chronological means every transaction happens after the previous one.</p>
        <p><b>Immutable:</b> It means as you build all the transaction onto the blockchain, this ledger can never be changed.</p>
        <p>A blockchain is a chain of blocks which contain information. Each block records all of the recent transactions, and once completed goes into the blockchain as a permanent database. Each time a block gets completed, a new block is generated.</p>
        <img src="/Images/blockchain.png" alt="">
        <h3>Who uses the blockchain?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies. It shows great promise across a wide range of business applications like Banking, Finance, Government, Healthcare, Insurance, Media and Entertainment, Retail, etc.</p>
        <h3>Need of Blockchain</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/blockchain2.png" alt="">
        <p><b>Time reduction:</b> In the financial industry, blockchain can allow the quicker settlement of trades. It does not take a lengthy process for verification, settlement, and clearance. It is because of a single version of agreed-upon data available between all stakeholders.</p>
        <p><b>Unchangeable transactions:</b> Blockchain register transactions in a chronological order which certifies the unalterability of all operations, means when a new block is added to the chain of ledgers, it cannot be removed or modified.</p>
        <p><b>Reliability:</b> Blockchain certifies and verifies the identities of each interested parties. This removes double records, reducing rates and accelerates transactions.</p>
        <p><b>Security: </b>Blockchain uses very advanced cryptography to make sure that the information is locked inside the blockchain. It uses Distributed Ledger Technology where each party holds a copy of the original chain, so the system remains operative, even the large number of other nodes fall.</p>
        <p><b>Collaboration:</b> It allows each party to transact directly with each other without requiring a third-party intermediary.</p>
        <p><b>Decentralized:</b> It is decentralized because there is no central authority supervising anything. There are standards rules on how every node exchanges the blockchain information. This method ensures that all transactions are validated, and all valid transactions are added one by one.</p>
        <h3>History of Blockchain</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>The blockchain technology was described in 1991 by the research scientist Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They wanted to introduce a computationally practical solution for time-stamping digital documents so that they could not be backdated or tampered. They develop a system using the concept of cryptographically secured chain of blocks to store the time-stamped documents.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Merkle Trees were incorporated into the design, which makes blockchain more efficient by allowing several documents to be collected into one block. Merkle Trees are used to create a 'secured chain of blocks.' It stored a series of data records, and each data records connected to the one before it. The newest record in this chain contains the history of the entire chain. However, this technology went unused, and the patent lapsed in 2004.</p>
        <img src="/Images/blockchain3.png" alt="">
        <p>In 2004, computer scientist and cryptographic activist Hal Finney introduced a system called Reusable Proof Of Work(RPoW) as a prototype for digital cash. It was a significant early step in the history of cryptocurrencies. The RPoW system worked by receiving a non-exchangeable or a non-fungible Hashcash based proof of work token in return, created an RSA-signed token that further could be transferred from person to person.

            RPoW solved the double-spending problem by keeping the ownership of tokens registered on a trusted server. This server was designed to allow users throughout the world to verify its correctness and integrity in real-time.</p>
        <p>Further, in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto conceptualized the theory of distributed blockchains. He improves the design in a unique way to add blocks to the initial chain without requiring them to be signed by trusted parties. The modified trees would contain a secure history of data exchanges. It utilizes a peer-to-peer network for timestamping and verifying each exchange. It could be managed autonomously without requiring a central authority. These improvements were so beneficial that makes blockchains as the backbone of cryptocurrencies. Today, the design serves as the public ledger for all transactions in the cryptocurrency space.

            The evolution of blockchains has been steady and promising. The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper but were eventually popularized as a single word, the Blockchain, by 2016. In recent time, the file size of cryptocurrency blockchain containing records of all transactions occurred on the network has grown from 20 GB to 100 GB.</p>
        <h3>What is Bitcoin?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the bitcoin in the year 2008. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency(virtual currency), or a digital currency that uses rules of cryptography for regulation and generation of units of currency. A Bitcoin fell under the scope of cryptocurrency and became the first and most valuable among them. It is commonly called decentralized digital currency.

            A bitcoin is a type of digital assets which can be bought, sold, and transfer between the two parties securely over the internet. Bitcoin can be used to store values much like fine gold, silver, and some other type of investments. We can also use bitcoin to buy products and services as well as make payments and exchange values electronically.
            
            A bitcoin is different from other traditional currencies such as Dollar, Pound, and Euro, which can also be used to buy things and exchange values electronically. There are no physical coins for bitcoins or paper bills. When you send bitcoin to someone or used bitcoin to buy anything, you don?t need to use a bank, a credit card, or any other third-party. Instead, you can simply send bitcoin directly to another party over the internet with securely and almost instantly.</p>
        <h3>How Bitcoin Works?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>When you send an email to another person, you just type an email address and can communicate directly to that person. It is the same thing when you send an instant message. This type of communication between two parties is commonly known as Peer-to-Peer communication.</p>
        <p>Whenever you want to transfer money to someone over the internet, you need to use a service of third-party such as banks, a credit card, a PayPal, or some other type of money transfer services. The reason for using third-party is to ensure that you are transferring that money. In other words, you need to be able to verify that both parties have done what they need to do in real exchange.</p>
        <p>For example, Suppose you click on a photo that you want to send it to another person, so you can simply attach that photo to an email, type the receiver email address and send it. The other person will receive the photo, and you think it would end, but it is not. Now, we have two copies of photo, one is a simple email, and another is an original file which is still on my computer. Here, we send the copy of the file of the photo, not the original file. This issue is commonly known as the double-spend problem.</p>
        <p>The double-spend problem provides a challenge to determine whether a transaction is real or not. How you can send a bitcoin to someone over the internet without needing a bank or some other institution to certify the transfer took place. The answer arises in a global network of thousands of computers called a Bitcoin Network and a special type of decentralized laser technology called blockchain.

            In Bitcoin, all the information related to the transaction is captured securely by using maths, protected cryptographically, and the data is stored and verified across the entire network of computers. In other words, instead of having a centralized database of the third-party such as banks to certify the transaction took place. Bitcoin uses blockchain technology across a decentralized network of computers to securely verify, confirm and record each transaction. Since data is stored in a decentralized manner across a wide network, there is no single point of failure. This makes blockchain more secure and less prone to fraud, tampering or general system failure than keeping them in a single centralized location.</p>
        <h3>Blockchain Hash Function</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>A hash function takes an input string (numbers, alphabets, media files) of any length and transforms it into a fixed length. The fixed bit length can vary (like 32-bit or 64-bit or 128-bit or 256-bit) depending on the hash function which is being used. The fixed-length output is called a hash. This hash is also the cryptographic byproduct of a hash algorithm. </p>
        <img src="/Images/blockchain5.png" alt="">
        <p><b>The hash algorithm has certain unique properties:</b></p>
        <p>&bull; It produces a unique output (or hash).</p>
        <p>&bull; It is a one-way function.</p>
        <h3>Basic Components of Bitcoin</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>&bull; Software</p>
        <p>&bull; Cryptography</p>
        <p>&bull; Hardware</p>
        <p>&bull; Miners(Gaming Theory)</p>
        <img src="/Images/blockchain4.png" alt="">
        <p><b>First Component: Software</b></p>
        <p>Bitcoin is basically a software at the core that defines what a bitcoin is, as well as how a bitcoin gets transferred. It identifies what the rules of a valid bitcoin, who can be inside bitcoin, who cannot be inside bitcoin, what is valid, what is not, etc. Everything is based on software, which is the bitcoin software. The bitcoin software is always operated in 24*7.</p>
        <p><b>Second component: Cryptography</b></p>
        <p>The software, at its core, uses cryptography and bitcoin as a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin uses cryptography to regulate the transfer of bitcoin between parties, as well as the creation of new units of bitcoin. Without cryptography, Bitcoin would simply not be possible. So, we've got that this software uses cryptography to control the transfer of bitcoin over the internet.

            Cryptography is a mathematical approach which is solvable by computers and not by humans. So all the stuff that protects your data is served by the cryptography.</p>
        <p><b>Third Component: Hardware</b></p>
        <p>To run and solve cryptography, it needs HARDWARE. This hardware is composed of those thousands of miners around the world running their computers. So there are thousands of computers around the world that are basically running the Bitcoin software or the Bitcoin client. This hardware is specially designed for finding Nonce to validate block and hash. It requires a lot of CPU power to complete a simple task on the bitcoin blockchain.</p>
        <p><b>Fourth Component: Mining(Gaming Theory)</b></p>
        <p>Miners are users who involved in a gaming theory because bitcoin is truly a game which is run by these miners around the world. In the above, we have seen that the first component is software for bitcoin that issues a cryptography challenge in every 10 minutes. The cryptography challenge involves in trying to find a Nonce which will make the hash for a specific block valid. All the hashes and validations are done by these miners. After successful creation of the block, the new block is added to the blockchain.</p>
        <h3>Key Concepts of Bitcoin</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>There are four key concepts that you need to aware in Bitcoin. These are:</p>
        <p>&bull; Disintermediated</p>
        <p>&bull; Distributed</p>
        <p>&bull; Decentralized</p>
        <p>&bull; Trustless</p>
        <p><b>Disintermediated</b></p>
        <p>When you send money to someone over the Internet, you need a third party like banks which manages all your transactions. But in Bitcoin
            , you are doing transactions directly to another party over the Internet. This transaction takes place in the Bitcoin network. This network takes care of confirming and verifying that there was a true transfer of value between the two parties. This concept is called Disintermediated.</p>
        <p>The Disintermediated is the act of removing the middleman. It is one of the key components that makes blockchain
            so valuable because it eliminates the unnecessary inefficiency that's involved when we are using a third-party during the transfer of value between parties.</p>
         <p><b>Distributed</b></p>
         <p>The entire bitcoin network runs on a network of thousands of distributed computers which shares the work. So, instead of having one centralized computer which handles the workload, you are distributing it across multiple computers. The distributed network is more reliable because there is no single point of failure. Here, the work is shared across thousands of computers which are all running and sharing the workload</p>
         <p><b>Decentralized</b></p>
         <p>Bitcoin is decentralized. It means that there is no central control, no central repository of data and no management in the middle that overseeing what Bitcoin does. As a result, there is no central point of failure.</p>
         <p><b>Trustless</b></p>
         <p>Bitcoin is Trustless because there is no need to have a third-party, such as a bank to certify and bring trust to the entire process of transactions. Instead, the blockchain and how Bitcoin process the transactions enable the trust is done by Distributed Trustless Consensus in which all the nodes agree that a transaction took place.</p>
         <h3>Blockchain Key Areas</h3>
         <hr>
         <br>
         <p>In the blockchain technology, bitcoin is the best-known implementation of the blockchain. There is a lot of development and the direction is based on the premise of what blockchain does to enable Bitcoin to happen. We can learn and expand how it can spread into so many different areas.</p>
         <p>The blockchain technology fixes three things that the Internet was not designed to do. These three things are:</p>
         <p>&bull;Value</p>
         <p>&bull;Trust</p>
        <p>&bull; Reliability</p>
        <p><b>Value</b></p>
        <p>With blockchain, you can actually create value on a digital asset. The value can be controlled by that person who owns it. It enables a unique asset to be transferred over the internet without a middle centralized agent.</p>
         <p><b>Trust</b></p>
         <p>Blockchain enables to securely assign ownership of a specific digital asset and be able to track who actually controls that asset at a time. In other words, blockchain creates a permanent, secure, unalterable record of who owns what. It uses advanced hash cryptography to preserve the integrity of the information.</p>
         <p><b>Reliability</b></p>
         <p>Blockchain distributes their workload among thousands of different computers worldwide. It provides reliability because if you have everything localized in one location, it becomes a single point of failure. But, its decentralized network structure ensures that there is no single point of failure which could bring the entire system down.</p>
         <h3>Limitation of Blockchain Technology</h3>
         <hr>
         <br>
         <p>Blockchain technology has enormous potential in creating trustless, decentralized applications. But it is not perfect. There are certain barriers which make the blockchain technology not the right choice and unusable for mainstream application. </p>
         <img src="/Images/blockchain6.png" alt="">
         <p><b>Lack of Awareness</b></p>
         <p><b>Limited availability of technical talent</b></p>
