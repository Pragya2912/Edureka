        <h3>Robotics</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Robotics is the term used in artificial intelligence that deals with a study of creating intelligent and efficient robots.</p>
        <img src="/Images/robotics.png" alt="">
         <h3>What are Robots?</h3>
         <hr>
         <br>
         <p>Robots are multifunctional, re-programmable, automatic industrial machine designed for replacing human in hazardous work.</p>
         <p>Robots can be work as:-</p>
         <p>&bull;An automatic machine sweeper</p>
         <p>&bull;    In space</p>
        <p>&bull;   A machine removing mines in a war field</p>
        <p>&bull;   An automatic car for a child to play with</p>
        <p>&bull;    In military, etc.</p>
         <h3>Objective</h3>
         <hr>
         <br>
         <p>The aim of the robot is to manipulate the objects by perceiving, moving, picking, modifying the physical properties of object.</p>
         <h3>What is Robotics?</h3>
         <hr>
         <br>
         <p>Robotics is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is mainly composed of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and computer science engineering for construction, designing and

            application of robots.
            Robotics is science of building or designing an application of robots. The aim of robotics is to design an efficient robot.</p>
        <h3>Aspects of Robotics</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>&bull; The robots have electrical components for providing power and control the machinery.</p>
        <p>&bull;    They have mechanical construction, shape, or form designed to accomplish a particular task.</p>
        <p>&bull;    It contains some type of computer program that determines what, when and how a robot does something.</p>
        <h3>First use of the word "Robotics"</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>The word robot was firstly introduced to public by Czech writer Karel Capek in his play Rossum's Universal Robots (R.U.R), published in 1920. The play begins with a factory that makes artificial people known as robots.

            The word "Robotics", was coined accidentally by the Russian-born, American scientist, Issac Asimov in 1940s .</p>
        <h3>The three laws of Robotics</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>&bull; Zeroth Law - A robot is not allowed to injured humanity, or, through inaction it allows humanity to come to harm.</p>
        <p>&bull;    First Law - A robot can not injure a human being, or, through inaction it allows a human being to come to harm, unless it would violate the higher order law.</p>
        <p>&bull;    Second Law - A robot should follow the orders given it by human beings, except when such orders give by humans would conflict with a higher order law.</p>
        <p>&bull;    Third Law - A robot is allowed to protect its own existence as long as such protection would not conflict with a higher order law.</p>
        <h3>Components of Robot</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Consider the robot structure showing different components of robots are:</p>
        <img src="/Images/robotics2.png" alt="">
        <h3>Types of Robots</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p><b>Mobile Robots </b></p>
        <p>Mobile robots are able to move from one location to another location using locomotion. It is an automatic machine that is capable of navigating an uncontrolled environment without any requirement of physical and electromechanical guidance devices. Mobile Robots are of two types:</p>
        <p><b>a) Rolling robots -</b>Rolling robots require wheels to move around. They can easily and quickly search. But they are only useful in flat areas.</p>
        <img src="/Images/robotics3.png" alt="">
        <p><b>(b) Walking robots - </b>Robots with legs are usually used in condition where the terrain is rocky. Most walking robots have at least 4 legs.</p>
        <img src="/Images/robotics4.png" alt="">
        <h3>2) Industrial Robots </h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Industrial robots perform same tasks repeatedly without ever moving. These robots are working in industries in which there is requirement of performing dull and repeated tasks suitable for robot.</p>
        <p>An industrial robot never tired, it will perform their works day and night without ever complaining.</p>
        <img src="/Images/robotics5.png" alt="">
        <h3>3) Autonomous Robots </h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Autonomous robots are self-supported. They use a program that provides them the opportunity to decide the action to perform depending on their surroundings.

            Using artificial intelligence these robots often learn new behavior. They start with a short routine and adapt this routine to be more successful in a task they perform. Hence, the most successful routine will be repeated.</p>
        <img src="/Images/robotics6.png" alt="">
        <h3>4) Remote Controlled Robots </h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Remote controlled robot used for performing complicated and undetermined tasks that autonomous robot cannot perform due to uncertainty of operation.

            Complicated tasks are best performed by human beings with real brainpower. Therefore a person can guide a robot by using remote. Using remote controlled operation human can perform dangerous tasks without being at the spot where the tasks are performed.</p>
         <p>Let's see a NASA robot designed to explore volcanoes via remote control:</p>

        <h3>Types of Robot Sensors</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>There are different type of sensors are available to choose from and the characteristics of sensors are used for determining the type of sensor to be used for particular application.</p>
        <h3>1) Light Sensor</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>

        <p>Light sensor is a transducer used for detecting light and creates a voltage difference equivalent to the light intensity fall on a light sensor.

            The two main light sensors used in robots are Photovoltaic cells and Photo resistor. Other kind of light sensors like phototransistors, phototubes are rarely used.</p>
        <p>The type of light sensors used in robotics are:</p>
        <p><b>Photo resistor -</b> It is a type of resistor used for detecting the light. In photo resistor resistance varies with change in light intensity. The light falls on photo resistor is inversely proportional to the resistance of the photo resistor. In general photo resistor is also called as Light Dependent Resistor (LDR).</p>
        <p><b>Photovoltaic Cells -</b> Photovoltaic cells are energy conversion device used to convert solar radiation into electrical electric energy. It is used if we are planning to build a solar robot. Individually photovoltaic cells are considered as an energy source, an implementation combined with capacitors and transistors can convert this into a sensor.</p>
         <h3>2) Proximity Sensor</h3>
         <hr>
         <br>
         <p>Proximity sensor can detect the presence of nearby object without any physical contact. The working of a proximity sensor is simple. In proximity sensor transmitter transmits an electromagnetic radiation and receiver receives and analyzes the return signal for interruptions. Therefore the amount of light receiver receives by surrounding can be used for detecting the presence of nearby object.</p>
         <p><b>Infrared (IR) Transceivers -</b>In IR sensor LED transmit the beam of IR light and if it find an obstacle then the light is reflected back which is captured by an IR receiver.</p>
         <p><b>Ultrasonic Sensor -</b> In ultrasonic sensors high frequency sound waves is generated by transmitter, the received echo pulse suggests an object interruption.

            In general ultrasonic sensors are used for distance measurement in robotic system.</p>
         <h3>3) Sound Sensor</h3>  
         <hr>
         <br>
         <p>Sound sensors are generally a microphone used to detect sound and return a voltage equivalent to the sound level. Using sound sensor a simple robot can be designed to navigate based on the sound receives.

            Implementation of sound sensors is not easy as light sensors because it generates a very small voltage difference which will be amplified to generate measurable voltage change.</p>      
        
        <h3>4) Temperature Sensor</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Temperature sensors are used for sensing the change in temperature of the surrounding. It is based on the principle of change in voltage difference for a change in temperature this change in voltage will provide the equivalent temperature value of the surrounding.</p>
        <h3>5) Acceleration Sensor</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Acceleration sensor is used for measuring acceleration and tilt. An accelerometer is a device used for measuring acceleration.</p>
        <p>The two kinds of forces which affect an accelerometer is:-</p>
        <p><b>Static Force -</b>It is the frictional force between any two objects. By measuring this gravitational force we can determine the how much robot is tilting. This measurement is useful in balancing robot, or for determining whether robot is driving on a flat surface or uphill.</p>
        <p><b>Dynamic Force -</b> It is the amount of acceleration required to move an object. Measurement of dynamic force using an accelerometer tells about the velocity/speed at which robot is moving. </p>
        <p>Accelerometer is comes in different configuration. Always use the one which is most appropriate for your robot. Some factors need to be considered before selecting accelerometer is:</p>
        <p>&bull;Sensitivity</p>
        <p>&bull;    Bandwidth</p>
        <p>&bull;    Output type: Analog or Digital</p>
        <p>&bull;    Number of Axis: 1,2 or 3</p>
