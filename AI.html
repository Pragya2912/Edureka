        <h3>What is artificial intelligence (AI)? </h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/AI2.jpg" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer
            systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition
            and machine vision.</p>
        <h3>How does AI work?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/AI3.jpg" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and
            services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI
            requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning
            algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are
            popular.</p>
        <p>In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for
            correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a
            chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image
            recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.</p>
        <p>AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.</p>
        <p><b>Learning processes</b>- This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how
            to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing
            devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.</p>
        <p> <b>Reasoning processes</b>- This aspect of AI programming focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a
            desired outcome.</p>
        <p><b>Self-correction processes</b>- This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune
            algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.</p>
        <h3>Why is artificial intelligence important?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>AI is important because it can give enterprises insights into their operations that they may not have been
            aware of previously and because, in some cases, AI can perform tasks better than humans. Particularly when
            it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks like analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure
            relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools often complete jobs quickly and with relatively few errors.
        </p>
        <p>This has helped fuel an explosion in efficiency and opened the door to entirely new business opportunities
            for some larger enterprises. Prior to the current wave of AI, it would have been hard to imagine using
            computer software to connect riders to taxis, but today Uber has become one of the largest companies in the
            world by doing just that. It utilizes sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict when people are
            likely to need rides in certain areas, which helps proactively get drivers on the road before they're
            needed. As another example, Google has become one of the largest players for a range of online services by
            using machine learning to understand how people use their services and then improving them. In 2017, the
            company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, pronounced that Google would operate as an "AI first" company.</p>
        <p>Today's largest and most successful enterprises have used AI to improve their operations and gain advantage
            on their competitors.</p>
        <h3>What are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Artificial neural network and deep learning artificial intelligence technologies are quickly evolving,
            primarily because AI processes large amounts of data much faster and makes predictions more accurately than
            humanly possible.

            While the huge volume of data being created on a daily basis would bury a human researcher, AI applications
            that use machine learning can take that data and quickly turn it into actionable information. As of this
            writing, the primary disadvantage of using AI is that it is expensive to process the large amounts of data
            that AI programming requires.</p>
        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>&bull; Good at detail-oriented jobs</p>
        <p> &bull; Reduced time for data-heavy tasks</p>
        <p> &bull; Delivers consistent results</p>
        <p> &bull; AI-powered virtual agents are always available</p>
        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>&bull; Expensive</p>
        <p> &bull; Requires deep technical expertise</p>
        <p> &bull; Limited supply of qualified workers to build AI tools</p>
        <p> &bull;Only knows what it's been shown</p>
        <p> &bull;Lack of ability to generalize from one task to another. </p>
        <h3>Strong AI vs. weak AI</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>AI can be categorized as either weak or strong.</p>
        <p>Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is an AI system that is designed and trained to complete a specific task.
            Industrial robots and virtual personal assistants, such as Apple's Siri, use weak AI.</p>
        <p>Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), describes programming that can replicate the
            cognitive abilities of the human brain. When presented with an unfamiliar task, a strong AI system can use
            fuzzy logic to apply knowledge from one domain to another and find a solution autonomously. In theory, a
            strong AI program should be able to pass both a Turing Test and the Chinese room test.</p>
        <h3>What are the 4 types of artificial intelligence?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/AI4.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>Arend Hintze, an assistant professor of integrative biology and computer science and engineering at Michigan
            State University, explained in a 2016 article that AI can be categorized into four types, beginning with the
            task-specific intelligent systems in wide use today and progressing to sentient systems, which do not yet
            exist. The categories are as follows:</p>
        <p><b>Type 1: Reactive machines</b>- These AI systems have no memory and are task specific. An example is Deep
            Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on the
            chessboard and make predictions, but because it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform
            future ones.</p>
        <p><b>Type 2: Limited memory</b>- These AI systems have memory, so they can use past experiences to inform
            future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in self-driving cars are designed this way.</p>
        <p><b>Type 3: Theory of mind</b>- Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it means that the
            system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer
            human intentions and predict behavior, a necessary skill for AI systems to become integral members of human
            teams.</p>
        <p><b>Type 4: Self-awareness</b> In this category, AI systems have a sense of self, which gives them
            consciousness. Machines with self-awareness understand their own current state. This type of AI does not yet
            exist.</p>
        <h3>What are examples of AI technology and how is it used today?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>AI is incorporated into a variety of different types of technology. Here are six examples:</p>
        <p><b>Automation</b>- When paired with AI technologies, automation tools can expand the volume and types of
            tasks performed. An example is robotic process automation (RPA), a type of software that automates
            repetitive, rules-based data processing tasks traditionally done by humans. When combined with machine
            learning and emerging AI tools, RPA can automate bigger portions of enterprise jobs, enabling RPA's tactical
            bots to pass along intelligence from AI and respond to process changes.</p>
        <p><b>Machine learning</b>- This is the science of getting a computer to act without programming. Deep learning
            is a subset of machine learning that, in very simple terms, can be thought of as the automation of
            predictive analytics. There are three types of machine learning algorithms: </p>
        <p><b>Supervised learning</b>- Data sets are labeled so that patterns can be detected and used to label new data
            sets.</p>
        <p><b>Unsupervised learning</b>- Data sets aren't labeled and are sorted according to similarities or
            differences.</p>
        <p><b>Reinforcement learning</b>- Data sets aren't labeled but, after performing an action or several actions,
            the AI system is given feedback.</p>
        <p><b>Machine vision</b>- This technology gives a machine the ability to see. Machine vision captures and
            analyzes visual information using a camera, analog-to-digital conversion and digital signal processing. It
            is often compared to human eyesight, but machine vision isn't bound by biology and can be programmed to see
            through walls, for example. It is used in a range of applications from signature identification to medical
            image analysis. Computer vision, which is focused on machine-based image processing, is often conflated with
            machine vision.</p>
        <p> <b>Natural language processing (NLP)</b>- This is the processing of human language by a computer program.
            One of the older and best-known examples of NLP is spam detection, which looks at the subject line and text
            of an email and decides if it's junk. Current approaches to NLP are based on machine learning. NLP tasks
            include text translation, sentiment analysis and speech recognition.</p>
        <p><b>Robotics</b>- This field of engineering focuses on the design and manufacturing of robots. Robots are
            often used to perform tasks that are difficult for humans to perform or perform consistently. For example,
            robots are used in assembly lines for car production or by NASA to move large objects in space. Researchers
            are also using machine learning to build robots that can interact in social settings.</p>
        <p><b>Self-driving cars</b>- Autonomous vehicles use a combination of computer vision, image recognition and
            deep learning to build automated skill at piloting a vehicle while staying in a given lane and avoiding
            unexpected obstructions, such as pedestrians.</p>
        <h3>What are the applications of AI?</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/AI5.webp" alt="">
        <br>
        <p><b>AI in healthcare</b>- The biggest bets are on improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. Companies are
            applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans. One of the best-known healthcare
            technologies is IBM Watson. It understands natural language and can respond to questions asked of it. The
            system mines patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it then presents with
            a confidence scoring schema. Other AI applications include using online virtual health assistants and
            chatbots to help patients and healthcare customers find medical information, schedule appointments,
            understand the billing process and complete other administrative processes. An array of AI technologies is
            also being used to predict, fight and understand pandemics such as COVID-19.</p>
        <p><b>AI in business</b>- Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and customer
            relationship management (CRM) platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots
            have been incorporated into websites to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions
            has also become a talking point among academics and IT analysts.</p>
        <p><b>AI in education</b>- AI can automate grading, giving educators more time. It can assess students and adapt
            to their needs, helping them work at their own pace. AI tutors can provide additional support to students,
            ensuring they stay on track. And it could change where and how students learn, perhaps even replacing some
            teachers.</p>
        <p><b>AI in finance</b>- AI in personal finance applications, such as Intuit Mint or TurboTax, is disrupting
            financial institutions. Applications such as these collect personal data and provide financial advice. Other
            programs, such as IBM Watson, have been applied to the process of buying a home. Today, artificial
            intelligence software performs much of the trading on Wall Street.</p>
        <p><b>AI in law</b>- The discovery process -- sifting through documents -- in law is often overwhelming for
            humans. Using AI to help automate the legal industry's labor-intensive processes is saving time and
            improving client service. Law firms are using machine learning to describe data and predict outcomes,
            computer vision to classify and extract information from documents and natural language processing to
            interpret requests for information.</p>
        <p><b>AI in manufacturing</b>- Manufacturing has been at the forefront of incorporating robots into the
            workflow. For example, the industrial robots that were at one time programmed to perform single tasks and
            separated from human workers, increasingly function as cobots: Smaller, multitasking robots that collaborate
            with humans and take on responsibility for more parts of the job in warehouses, factory floors and other
            workspaces.</p>
        <p><b>AI in transportation</b>- In addition to AI's fundamental role in operating autonomous vehicles, AI
            technologies are used in transportation to manage traffic, predict flight delays, and make ocean shipping
            safer and more efficient.</p>
        <p><b>Security</b>- AI and machine learning are at the top of the buzzword list security vendors use today to
            differentiate their offerings. Those terms also represent truly viable technologies. Organizations use
            machine learning in security information and event management (SIEM) software and related areas to detect
            anomalies and identify suspicious activities that indicate threats. By analyzing data and using logic to
            identify similarities to known malicious code, AI can provide alerts to new and emerging attacks much sooner
            than human employees and previous technology iterations. The maturing technology is playing a big role in
            helping organizations fight off cyber attacks.</p>
        <h3>Augmented intelligence vs. artificial intelligence </h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p><b>Augmented intelligence</b>- Some researchers and marketers hope the label augmented intelligence, which
            has a more neutral connotation, will help people understand that most implementations of AI will be weak and
            simply improve products and services. Examples include automatically surfacing important information in
            business intelligence reports or highlighting important information in legal filings.</p>
        <p><b>Artificial intelligence</b>- True AI, or artificial general intelligence, is closely associated with the
            concept of the technological singularity -- a future ruled by an artificial superintelligence that far
            surpasses the human brain's ability to understand it or how it is shaping our reality. This remains within
            the realm of science fiction, though some developers are working on the problem. Many believe that
            technologies such as quantum computing could play an important role in making AGI a reality and that we
            should reserve the use of the term AI for this kind of general intelligence.</p>
        <h3>Ethical use of artificial intelligence</h3>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>While AI tools present a range of new functionality for businesses, the use of artificial intelligence also
            raises ethical questions because, for better or worse, an AI system will reinforce what it has already
            learned.</p>
        <p>This can be problematic because machine learning algorithms, which underpin many of the most advanced AI
            tools, are only as smart as the data they are given in training. Because a human being selects what data is
            used to train an AI program, the potential for machine learning bias is inherent and must be monitored
            closely.</p>
        <p>Anyone looking to use machine learning as part of real-world, in-production systems needs to factor ethics
            into their AI training processes and strive to avoid bias. This is especially true when using AI algorithms
            that are inherently unexplainable in deep learning and generative adversarial network (GAN) applications.
        </p>
        <p>Explainability is a potential stumbling block to using AI in industries that operate under strict regulatory
            compliance requirements. For example, financial institutions in the United States operate under regulations
            that require them to explain their credit-issuing decisions. When a decision to refuse credit is made by AI
            programming, however, it can be difficult to explain how the decision was arrived at because the AI tools
            used to make such decisions operate by teasing out subtle correlations between thousands of variables. When
            the decision-making process cannot be explained, the program may be referred to as black box AI.</p>
