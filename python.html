        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python programming language
            (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting
            edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners, also
            for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java. <br>
            <br>
            <img src="/Images/Python-Programming-Language.png" alt=""><br><br>

            This specially designed Python tutorial will help you learn Python Programming Language in most efficient
            way, with the topics from basics to advanced (like Web-scraping, Django, Deep-Learning, etc.) with examples.
            <br>

            Below are some facts about Python Programming Language: <br>

            1.Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.
            2.Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms. <br>
            3.Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type
            relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time. <br>
            4.Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook,
            Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.
            The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:
            <br>
            -> Machine Learning <br>
            -> GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. ) <br>
            -> Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)
            -> Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow) <br>
            -> Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium) <br>
            -> Test frameworks <br>
            -> Multimedia <br>
            -> Scientific computing <br>
            -> Text processing and many more.. <br>
        </p><br><br>
        Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in
        1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code
        readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. <br>

        Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.<br><br>


        There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.<br><br>

        <h2>

            Beginning with Python programming:</h2><br>
        <h3> 1) Finding an Interpreter: </h3><br>
        Before we start Python programming, we need to have an interpreter to interpret and run our programs. There are
        certain online interpreters like <a
            href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/">https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/</a>
        that can be used to run Python programs without
        installing an interpreter.<br><br>

        <h4> Windows:</h4> There are many interpreters available freely to run Python scripts like IDLE (Integrated
        Development
        Environment) that comes bundled with the Python software downloaded from http://python.org/. <br><br>

        <h4>Linux:</h4> Python comes preinstalled with popular Linux distros such as Ubuntu and Fedora. To check which
        version of
        Python you’re running, type “python” in the terminal emulator. The interpreter should start and print the
        version number. <br><br>

        <h4>macOS: </h4> Generally, Python 2.7 comes bundled with macOS. You’ll have to manually install Python 3 from
        <a href="http://python.org/">http://python.org/</a><br><br>

        <h2> LANGUAGE FEATURES </h2><br>

        <h4> Interpreted </h4>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>-></b> There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>-></b> Directly run the program from the source code. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>-></b> Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is then translated
        into native language of specific computer to run it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>-></b> No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc. <br><br>
        <h4> Platform Independent </h4>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>-></b> Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;platforms.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>-></b> Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <h4> Free and Open Source</h4>

        <h4><br>
            High-level Language</h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>-></b> In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the
        program. <br><br>
        <h4>
            Simple </h4> &nbsp;&nbsp;

        <b>-></b> Closer to English language;Easy to Learn <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;

        <b>-></b> More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax <br><br>
        <h4>
            Embeddable </h4>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;

        <b>-></b> Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.
        <br><br>
        <h4>
            Robust </h4>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;

        <b>-></b> Exceptional handling features <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>-></b> Memory management techniques in built <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <h4>
            Rich Library Support </h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>-></b> The Python Standard Library is very vast. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <b>-></b> Known as the “batteries included” philosophy of Python ;It can help do various
        things&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; involving regular
        expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML,
        WAV files, cryptography, GUI and&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        many more.
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>-></b> Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries such as the&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Python Imaging Library
        which is an amazingly simple image manipulation library. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <h5> Softwares making use of Python
        </h5><br>
        Python has been successfully embedded in a number of software products as a scripting language. <br> <br>

        1.GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;containers. <br>
        2.Python has also been used in artificial intelligence <br>
        3. Python is often used for natural language processing tasks. <br> <br>
        <h5>
            Current Applications of Python
        </h5>
        1.A number of Linux distributions use installers written in Python example in Ubuntu we have
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the <b>Ubiquity</b><br>
        2.Python has seen extensive use in the information security industry, including in exploit
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development. <br>
        3.Raspberry Pi– single board computer uses Python as its principal user-programming
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;language.<br>
        4.Python is now being used Game Development areas also. <br><br>
        <h5>
            Pros:
        </h5>
        1.Ease of use <br>
        2.Multi-paradigm Approach <br><br>
        <h5>
            Cons:
        </h5>
        1.Slow speed of execution compared to C,C++ <br>
        2.Absence from mobile computing and browsers <br>
        3.For the C,C++ programmers switching to python can be irritating as the language requires
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proper indentation of
        code. Certain variable names commonly used like sum are functions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in python. So C, C++
        programmers have to look
        out for these. <br><br><br>
        <h5>
            Industrial Importance
        </h5>
        Most of the companies are now looking for candidates who know about Python Programming. Those having the
        knowledge of python may have more chances of impressing the interviewing panel. So I would suggest that
        beginners should start learning python and excel in it. <br>

        Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code
        readability. It has fewer steps when compared to Java and C. It was founded in 1991 by developer Guido Van
        Rossum. Python ranks among the most popular and fastest-growing languages in the world. Python is a powerful,
        flexible, and easy-to-use language. In addition, the community is very active there. It is used in many
        organizations as it supports multiple programming paradigms. It also performs automatic memory management.

        So before moving on further.. let’s do the most popular ‘HelloWorld’ tradition 😛 and hence compare Python’s
        Syntax with C, C++, Java ( I have taken these 3 because they are most famous and mostly used languages).
        <br>

        <b>Note:</b> Please note that Python for its scope doesn’t depend on the braces ( { } ), instead it uses
        indentation
        for its scope. <br>
        Now moving on further <b> Lets start our basics of Python </b>. I will be covering the basics in some small
        sections.
        Just go through them and trust me you’ll learn the basics of Python very easily. <br>
