        JavaScript is the world most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as scripting language for web pages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. <br><br>
        <img src="/Images/JavaScriptTutorial.png" alt=""><br><br>


        JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways: <br>
        <ul>
            <h5>
           <li> Internal JS:</h5> We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the script tag. The script tag can either be placed inside the head or the body tag according to the requirement. <br><br></li>
            <h5>
              <li>  External JS:</h5> We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension .js and then link this file inside the head tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.</li>
        </ul>


<h4>
        Are JavaScript and HTML the same?
        </h4>
        <ul>

<li>JavaScript is an advanced programming language that makes web pages more interactive and dynamic whereas HTML is a standard markup language that provides the primary structure of a website.</li>

<li>JavaScript simply adds dynamic content to websites to make them look good and HTML work on the look of the website without the interactive effects and all.</li>

<li>JavaScript manipulates the content to create dynamic web pages whereas HTML pages are static which means the content cannot be changed.</li>

<li>JavaScript is not cross-browser compatible whereas HTML is cross-browser compatible.</li>

<li>JavaScript can be embedded inside HTML but HTML can not be embedded inside JavaScript.</li>

</ul>
<br>

<h4>What is JavaScript used for?</h4>
<ul>

    <li><b>Web pages with interactive elements: </b>User interaction with web pages is enabled through JavaScript. On a web page, JavaScript has essentially no bounds.</li>
<li><b>Developing online and mobile applications: </b>For web and mobile app development, developers can employ a variety of JavaScript frameworks.</li>
<li><b>Creating web servers and server applications:</b> Aside from websites and apps, developers may use JavaScript to create simple web servers and Node.js to construct backend infrastructure.</li>
<li><b>Game Development:</b> Browser games can also be made using JavaScript. Beginning developers can use these to hone their JavaScript skills.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>
Is JavaScript easy to learn?
</h4>

In comparison to other programming languages such as C++, Ruby, and Python, JavaScript is simple and easy to learn. The difficulty of learning JavaScript is primarily determined by your knowledge of other programming languages. Understanding HTML is the first step toward learning JavaScript. Because JavaScript is most commonly used as part of a web page, which can only be learned through HTML.
<br><br>

<h4>
What can we build using JavaScript ?
</h4>
JavaScript is a widely-used programming language. Given below are some domains/products that can be built using JavaScript: <br><br>
<ul>

<li><b>Websites:</b> JavaScript helps us to add behavior of our website. It helps users to interact with the website. For eg. clicking on buttons, saving details, uploading details on the website, etc.</li>
<li><b>Web Servers:</b> We can make robust server applications using JavaScript. To be precise we use JavaScript frameworks like Node.js and Express.js to build these servers.</li>
<li><b>Game Development:</b> In Game Development industry, JavaScript is used widely. With the addition of HTML5 Canvas, it’s now possible to make 2D and 3D games in JavaScript very efficiently.</li>
<li><b>3D Drawings:</b> JavaScript in addition with HTML Canvas is used to make three-dimensional graphics.</li>
<li><b>Mobile Apps:</b> Mobile applications are the most popular modes of communicating these days. JavaScript also used to design mobile applications. There are many JavaScript frameworks using which we can make android, IOS, and hybrid apps.</li>
<li><b>Smartwatch Apps:</b> The popular smartwatch maker Pebble has created Pebble.js, a small JavaScript framework that allows a developer to create an application for the Pebble line of watches in JavaScript.</li></ul>
<br>


<h4>

<h3>Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
<br>
JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. <br><br>

<img src="/Images/JavaScript-Introduction.jpg" alt=""><br><br>


<ul>
    
<li><b>Client-side:</b> It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.</li>
<li><b>Server-side:</b> It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.</li>
<li><b>Imperative language –</b> In this type of language we are mostly concern about how it is to be done . It simply control the flow of computation . The procedural programming approach , object, oriented approach comes under this like async await we are thinking what it is to be done further after async call.</li>
<li><b>Declarative programming –</b> In this type of language we are concern about how it is to be done , basically here logical computation require . Here  main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it like  arrow function do .</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways: <br><br>
<ul>
    <h5>
   <li> Internal JS:</h5> We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the script tag. The script tag can either be placed inside the head or the body tag according to the requirement. <br><br></li>
    <h5>
      <li>  External JS:</h5> We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension .js and then link this file inside the head tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h4>
History of JavaScript:</h4> It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser. <br><br>
<b>
Features of JavaScript:</b> According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most popular language on earth. 
With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more. Here are a few things that we can do with JavaScript: <br>
<ul>
    <li>JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.</li>
<li>Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be passed as arguments in other functions.</li>
<li>Can handle date and time.</li>
<li>Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.</li>
<li>No compiler is needed.</li>
</ul>
<br>


<h4>
    Applications of Javascript
</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Web Development:</b> Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented to do this in 1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.</li>
<li><b>Web Applications:</b> With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language was required to create robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need to click and drag the mouse. All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because of JavaScript. It uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code. The Electron and React is helpful in this department.</li>
<li><b>Server Applications:</b> With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to server and node.js is the most powerful on the server-side.</li>
<li><b>Games:</b> Not only in websites, but JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure. The combination of JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well. It provides the EaseJS library which provides solutions for working with rich graphics.</li>
<li><b>Smartwatches:</b> JavaScript is being used in all possible devices and applications. It provides a library PebbleJS which is used in smartwatch applications. This framework works for applications that require the internet for its functioning.</li>
<li><b>Art:</b> Artists and designers can create whatever they want using JavaScript to draw on HTML 5 canvas, and make the sound more effective also can be used p5.js library.</li>
<li><b>Machine Learning:</b> This JavaScript ml5.js library can be used in web development by using machine learning.</li>
<li><b>Mobile Applications:</b> JavaScript can also be used to build an application for non-web contexts. The features and uses of JavaScript make it a powerful tool for creating mobile applications. This is a Framework for building web and mobile apps using JavaScript. Using React Native, we can build mobile applications for different operating systems. We do not require to write code for different systems. Write once use it anywhere!</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>
Limitations of JavaScript: 
</h4>
<ul>

 <li><b>Security risks:</b> JavaScript can be used to fetch data using AJAX or by manipulating tags that load data such as img, object, script. These attacks are called cross site script attacks. They inject JS that is not the part of the site into the visitor’s browser thus fetching the details. </li>
<li><b>Performance:</b> JavaScript does not provide the same level of performance as offered by many traditional languages as a complex program written in JavaScript would be comparatively slow. But as JavaScript is used to perform simple tasks in a browser, so performance is not considered a big restriction in its use.</li>
<li><b>Complexity:</b> To master a scripting language, programmers must have a thorough knowledge of all the programming concepts, core language objects, client and server-side objects otherwise it would be difficult for them to write advanced scripts using JavaScript.</li>
<li><b>Weak error handling and type checking facilities:</b> It is weakly typed language as there is no need to specify the data type of the variable. So wrong type checking is not performed by compile.</li>

   </ul>
   <br>
   <h4>Why JavaScript is known as a lightweight programming language?</h4><br>
   JavaScript is considered as lightweight due to the fact that it has low CPU usage, is easy to implement and has a minimalist syntax. Minimalist syntax as in, it has no data types. Everything is treated here as an object. It is very easy to learn because of its syntax similar to C++ and Java. <br>

A lightweight language does not consume much of your CPU’s resources. It doesn’t put excess strain on your CPU or RAM. JavaScript runs in the browser even though it has complex paradigms and logic which means it uses fewer resources than other languages. For example, NodeJs, a variation of JavaScript not only performs faster computations but also uses less resources than its counterparts such as Dart or Java. <br>

Additionally, when compared with other programming languages, it has less in-built libraries or frameworks, contributing as another reason for it to be lightweight. However, this brings it a drawback that we need to incorporate external libraries and frameworks.  <br><br>

<h4>Is JavaScript compiled or interpreted or both?</h4><br>
JavaScript is both compiled and interpreted. In the earlier versions of JavaScript, it used only the interpreter that executed code line by line and shows the result immediately. But with time the performance became an issue as interpretation is quite slow. Therefore, in the newer versions of JS, probably after the V8, JIT compiler was also incorporated to optimize the execution and display the result more quickly. This JIT compiler generates a bytecode that is relatively easier to code. This bytecode is a set of highly optimized instructions.  <br>
The V8 engine initially uses an interpreter, to interpret the code. On further executions, the V8 engine finds patterns such as frequently executed functions, frequently used variables, and compiles them to improve performance. <br>

JavaScript is best known for web page development but it is also used in a variety of non-browser environments. <br><br>
