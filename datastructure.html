        <h2>What is Data Structure?</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <img src="/Images/datastructure.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <p>A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.</p>
        <h2>Classification of Data Structure</h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>&bull;<b>Linear data structure - </b> Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. </p>
        <p>Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.</p>
        <p>&bull;<b>Static data structure - </b> Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
            An example of this data structure is an array.</p>
        <p>&bull;<b>Dynamic data structure- </b> In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. </p>
        <p>Examples of this data structure are queue, stack.</p>
        <p>&bull;<b>Non-linear data structure- </b> Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. </p>
        <p>Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.</p>
        <p><b>Data structures are used in various fields such as:</b></p>
        <p> &bull; Operating system</p>
          <p>  &bull; Graphics </p>
          <p> &bull; Computer Design</p>
         <p>&bull; Blockchain</p>
          <p> &bull; Genetics</p>
         <p>&bull; Image Processing</p>
         <p>&bull; Simulation etc.</p>

         <p><b>Below is an overview of some popular data structures: </b></p>
         <p>1)<b>Array: </b>An array is a collection of data items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).</p>
         <p>2)<b>Linked Lists: </b>Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.</p>
         <p>3)<b>Stack: </b>Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). In stack, all insertion and deletion are permitted at only one end of the list.</p>
         <p><b>Mainly the following three basic operations are performed in the stack: </b></p>
         <p>&bull; <b>Initialize: </b>Make a stack empty.</p>
         <p>&bull; <b>Push:</b> Adds an item in the stack. If the stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition</p>
         <p>&bull;<b> Pop: </b>Removes an item from the stack. The items are popped in the reversed order in which they are pushed. If the stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.</p>
         <p>&bull; <b>Peek or Top: </b>Returns top element of the stack.</p>
         <p>&bull;<b>isEmpty: </b>Returns true if the stack is empty, else false.</p>
         <p>4) <b>Queue: </b>Like Stack, Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). In the queue, items are inserted at one end and deleted from the other end. A good example of the queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added. </p>
         <p> <b>Mainly the following four basic operations are performed on queue: </b></p>
         <p> &bull;<b>Enqueue:</b> Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.</p>
        <p> &bull; <b>Dequeue:</b> Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.</p>
        <p>&bull;<b>Front: </b>Get the front item from the queue.</p>
        <p>&bull;<b>Rear:</b> Get the last item from the queue.</p>
        <p>5) <b>Binary Tree: </b>Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures. A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. It is implemented mainly using Links. 

            A Binary Tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in the tree. If the tree is empty, then the value of root is NULL. A Binary Tree node contains the following parts. </p>
         <p>6)<b>Binary Search Tree:</b> A Binary Search Tree is a Binary Tree following the additional properties: 
 

            The left part of the root node contains keys less than the root node key.
            The right part of the root node contains keys greater than the root node key.
            There is no duplicate key present in the binary tree.
        
              A Binary tree having the following properties is known as Binary search tree (BST).</p>
        <p>7)<b> Heap:</b> A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types: </p>
 

         <p>  <b>Max-Heap: </b>In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
         <p> <b>Min-Heap: </b>In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.</p>
       
       <p>8)<b>Hashing Data Structure: </b>Hashing is an important Data Structure which is designed to use a special function called the Hash function which is used to map a given value with a particular key for faster access of elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used. 

        Let a hash function H(x) maps the value x at the index x%10 in an Array. For example, if the list of values is [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] it will be stored at positions {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} in the array or Hash table respectively. </p>
       <p>9)<b>Matrix:</b> A matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in an order of rows and columns. It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets. </p>
        <p>10) <b>Trie:</b> Trie is an efficient information reTrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to an optimal limit (key length). If we store keys in the binary search tree, a well-balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, where M is maximum string length and N is the number of keys in the tree. Using Trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. However, the penalty is on Trie storage requirements. </p>
     <h3>Arrays</h3>
     <hr>
     <br>
     <img src="/Images/array.png" alt="">
     <br>
     <p>An array is a linear data structure and it is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together in one place. It allows the processing of a large amount of data in a relatively short period. The first element of the array is indexed by a subscript of 0. There are different operations possible in an array, like Searching, Sorting, Inserting, Traversing, Reversing, and Deleting.

    <h3>Stack</h3>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <img src="/Images/stack.png" alt="">
    <br>
    <p>Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is LIFO(Last in first out). Entering and retrieving data is possible from only one end. The entering and retrieving of data is also called push and pop operation in a stack. There are different operations possible in a stack like reversing a stack using recursion, Sorting, Deleting the middle element of a stack, etc.</p>
    <p><b>Characteristics of a Stack</b></p>

    <p>&bull;Stack is implemented through array or linked list.</p>
    <p>&bull;It follows Last In First Out operation i.e., element which is inserted first will pop in last and vice versa.</p>
    <p>&bull;The insertion and deletion happens at one end i.e. from the top of the stack.</p>
    <p> &bull;In stack, if allocated space for stack is full, and still anyone attempts to add more elements, it will lead to stack overflow.</p>
    <p><b>Applications of Stack</b></p>
    <p>Different applications of Stack are as follows</p>
    <p>Stack data structure is used in evaluation and conversion of arithmetic expressions.</p>

    <p>&bull;Real life example of a stack is the layer of eating plates arranged one above the other. When you remove a plate from the pile, you can take the plate on the top of the pile. But this is exactly the plate that was added most recently to the pile. If you want the plate at the bottom of the pile, you must remove all the plates on top of it to reach it. </p>
    <p>&bull; Browsers use stack data structure to keep track of previously visited sites.</p>
   <p>&bull;Call log in mobile also uses stack data structure. </p>
   <h3>Queue</h3>
   <hr>
   <br>
   <img src="/Images/queue.png" alt="">
   <br>
   <p>Queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out(FIFO) i.e. the data item stored first will be accessed first. In this, entering and retrieving data is not done from only one end. An example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. Different operations are performed on Queue like Reversing a Queue (with or without using recursion), Reversing the first K elements of a Queue, etc. Few basic operations performed In Queue are enqueue, dequeue, front, rear, etc.</p>
   <p><b>Characteristics of a Queue</b></p>
   <p>Queue has various different characteristics which are as follows</p>
   <p>&bull;Queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) structure.</p>
   <p>&bull;To remove the last element of Queue, all the elements inserted before the new element in the queue must be removed.
   <p>&bull; A queue is an ordered list of elements of similar data types.</p>

     <img src="/Images/tree.png" alt="">
     <br>
     <p>A tree is a non-linear and hierarchal data structure where the elements are arranged in a tree-like structure. In a tree, the topmost node is called the root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. It consists of a central node, structural nodes, and sub-nodes which are connected via edges. Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure. A tree has various terminologies like Node, Root, Edge, Height of a tree, Degree of a tree, etc. </p>

       <h3>Graph</h3>
       <hr>
       <br>
       <img src="/Images/graph.png" alt="">
       <br>
       <p>A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (or nodes) and edges. It consists of a finite set of vertices and set of edges that connect a pair of nodes. Graph is used to solve the most challenging and complex programming problems. It has different terminologies which are Path, Degree, Adjacent vertices, Connected components, etc.</p>
      <p><b>Characteristics of Graph:</b></p>
      <p>Graph has various different characteristics which are as follows:</p>

        <p>&bull;The maximum distance from a vertex to all the other vertices is considered as the Eccentricity of that vertex.</p>
        <p>&bull;  The vertex having minimum Eccentricity is considered the central point of the graph.</p>
        <p>&bull;The minimum value of Eccentricity from all vertices is considered as the radius of a connected graph.</p>
     <p><b>Applications of Graph</b></p>
     <p>Different applications of Graph are as follows:</p>

     <p>&bull;Graph is used to represent the flow of computation.</p>

    <p><b>Real-Life Applications of Graph</b></p>
    <p> &bull;One of the most common real-world examples of a graph is Google Maps where cities are located as vertices and paths connecting those vertices are located as edges of the graph.</p>
    <p> &bull; A social network is also one real-world example of a graph where every person on the network is a node, and all of their friendships on the network are the edges of the graph.</p>
    <p> &bull; A graph is also used to study molecules in physics and chemistry. </p>

    <p>Although these are the most widely known and used data structures, there are some other forms of data structures as well which are used in Computer Science, such as policy-based data structures, etc. But no matter which data structure you choose, each one has its perks and disadvantages, without the knowledge of which, it can be very costly to choose the wrong type of data structure. So it is very important to understand the need of the situation, and then decide which kind of data structure suits best for the job.</p>
